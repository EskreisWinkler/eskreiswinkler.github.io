            <li><b> Multiresolution Analysis of Graphs:</b> State of the art network analysis grapples with learning graph structure for larger datasets than ever before. Manageable challenges from a decade ago -- such as graph partitioning or graph-based <a href="http://galton.uchicago.edu/~eskreiswinkler/Research/SSL_limit.html"> semi-supervised learning </a> -- have become much more challenging. Applying even recently developed techniques for tasks such as community detection require approximations if they are expected to remain useful in the coming years. Multiresolution analysis provides a unique lens through which to consider these problems. Many of the questions in network analysis reduce to the consideration of network properties at a certain level of resolution. By applying techniques from multiresolution analysis (in an efficient manner) to graphs, questions regarding global graph structure (such as graph partitioning) and local graph structure (such as community detection) may be addressed in a constructive manner. Several methods for constructing wavelets on graphs are already in use, along with mechanisms for translating graph wavelets into analytical tools. I hope to build on this work by developing new multiresolution tools to an array of contemporary problems. Some of my recent work on community detection is found <a href="http://galton.uchicago.edu/~eskreiswinkler/Research/community_detection.html"> here</a>.

            <li><b> Applications of Random Forests towards Graph-based Learning:</b> The intersection of the easily deployable random forest with hierarchical structure is of interest. My cental idea is to unify collections of tree approximations with hyperbolic embeddings. <a href:"https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2018/03/19/hyperbolics/">New work on hyperbolic embeddings</a> has shown that complicated discrete structures can be efficiently and accurately embedded in low dimensional hyperbolic spaces. The broader field of random forests in machine learning can be connected to this work using tree approximations of graphs.

            <li><b> Multiresolution Matrix Factorization (MMF):</b> Currently working with <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~risi/"> Risi Kondor </a> on applications of a novel decomposition tool from computational harmonic analysis. By factorizing large symmetric matrices into a dictionary of sparse wavelets, scenarios that tend to require a matrix's full eigenvalue decomposition may be approximated by a wavelet decomposition. We are considering improvements to MMF using new results in hyperbolic embeddings of data. A publicly available library for implementing a parallelized MMF computation is available <a href = "http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~risi/MMF/index.html"> here</a>. </li>

            <li><b> Gaussian Processes (GPs) for large datasets:</b> Many applications of GPs, such as GP regression (GPR), are currently hampered by computational bottlenecks, such as matrix inversion and determinant computation. I am interested in investigating approaches to approximating covariance matrices in ways that make matrix computations scale to massive datasets without sacrificing accuracy. </li>
			
            <li><b> Retrospective data-analysis and medical decision-making:</b> As data collection becomes easier, the size and scope of hospitals' patient-oriennted databases continues to grow without forseeable limits. I am interested in ways to use modern nonparametric methods to make robust predictions that scale well with the number of database records. Specifically, I am interested in time-series data of patients' intraoperative vitals and how they can be used to make recommendations to anesthesiologists regarding medication dosage.</li>
